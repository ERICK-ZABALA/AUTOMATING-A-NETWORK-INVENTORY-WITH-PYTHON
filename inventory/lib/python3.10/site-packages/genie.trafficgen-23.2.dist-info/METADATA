Genie Traffic Component
=======================

Genie is both a library framework and a test harness that facilitates rapid
development, encourage re-usable and simplify writing test automation. Genie
bundled with the modular architecture of pyATS framework accelerates and 
simplifies test automation leveraging all the perks of the Python programming
language in an object-orienting fashion.

pyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and
reusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development
iterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers start with small,
simple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous
test suites.

Genie was initially developed internally in Cisco, and is now available to the
general public starting early 2018 through `Cisco DevNet`_. Visit the Genie

Traffic Package
---------------

This is a sub-component of Genie that provides connection implementations to
communicate with traffic generator devices.

Requirements
------------

Genie currently supports Python 3.4+ on Linux & Mac systems. Windows platforms
are not yet supported.

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: console

    # install genie as a whole
    $ pip install genie.trafficgen

    # to upgrade this package manually
    $ pip install --upgrade genie.trafficgen

    # to install alpha/beta versions, add --pre
    $ pip install --pre genie.trafficgen


For more information on setting up your Python development environment,
such as creating virtual environment and installing ``pip`` on your system, 
please refer to `Virtual Environment and Packages`_ in Python tutorials.
